# Overview
This project is to help me become more familiar with goespacial data.
I decided to use **Javascript** and **HTML** insead of doing it all in R studio, or the Python API becuase I want to become more familiar with Javascript and HTML.

Data is the longitude and latatude of US state capitals, found on GitHub.
